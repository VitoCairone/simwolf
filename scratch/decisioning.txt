    * TODO: consider when to allow adult Wolves to prefer hunting solo?  
  when none apply, select at random (based on evoWts)
    near others: follow social patrol explore
    alone: patrol explore

  note (7/7/2025) this version of pre-determined strict priority will be replaced
  with three-tiered evo-controlled ratios; such that the actual priority results
  from selective structuring. We keep this original plan in mind, expecting
  the average selective result to resemble it, and should support all
  the required specifics.

  // every critter's highest decision Wt should be fixed at 1.0 [or 0xFF?]
  // and others scaled accordingly
